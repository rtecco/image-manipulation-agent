Extract the important text, visual regions and styling elements of this ad. Then come up with a detailed multi-step plan to re-arrange them into a new IAB standard Leaderboard banner ad by writing a Python program. In each step, you will write Python code using common libraries to implement the next stage. You can use Pillow, OpenCV, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and scikit-image. Do not use cv2. You will be able to re-use variables and functions between steps. You will be able to pass the output of `print()` statements between steps. Consider proper alpha blending. Layer visual elements first onto a background first and then add text last. Don't just resize the source image. Do not write any code yet. The source image dimensions are width={width} and height={height}. Include the number of steps in the plan like this: STEPS=`<number of steps>`.
