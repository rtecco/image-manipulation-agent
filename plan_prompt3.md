Extract the important text, visual regions and styling elements of this image. Then come up with a multi-step plan to solve the following problem by writing a Python program: {task}. In each step, you will write Python code using common libraries to implement the next stage. You can use Pillow, OpenCV, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and scikit-image. Do not use cv2. You will be able to re-use variables and functions between steps. You will be able to pass the output of `print()` statements between steps. Do not include separate steps for re-formatting or conversions. Remember, you already have the important text and the coordinates of the most important visual regions. Consider proper alpha blending. Stack elements onto a background but not stack elements on top of each other. Do not write any code yet. The source image dimensions are width={width} and height={height}. Include the number of steps in the plan like this: STEPS=`<number of steps>`.
