It is iteration {i}. Write the Python program to implement step {i} of your plan. You can use Pillow, OpenCV, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and scikit-image. Do not use cv2. The Python you generate will be executed in a sandbox on macOS. The original source image is in a variable called `image_clue_0`. You can reference variables and functions set by the previous code snippets; you don't need I/O. Your output should be a PIL image in `image_clue_{i}`. You can also `print()` to output program results. Output your code in `<code></code>` blocks.
