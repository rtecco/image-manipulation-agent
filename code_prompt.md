It is iteration {i}. The image from the previous iteration (if any) is included. Write the Python program to implement step {i} of your plan. If the image from the past iteration looks unnatural, include Python to correct it. You can use Pillow, OpenCV, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and scikit-image. Do not use cv2. The Python you generate will be executed in a sandbox on macOS. The original source image is in a variable called `image_clue_0`. You can reference variables and functions set by the previous code snippets; you don't need I/O. The code output should be a JPEG PIL image assigned to `image_clue_{i}`. You can also `print()` to output program results. Output your code in `<code></code>` blocks.
