 Extract the important text, visual regions of this ad and styling elements of this ad. Then write a Python program to re-composite the text and visual regions into a new IAB standard Leaderboard banner ad. Preserve the visual styling. You can use Pillow, OpenCV, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and scikit-image in the Python. Remember, you already have the important text and visual regions. You just need to leverage Python to re-composite them with the right visual styling. The final PIL image should be set to `image_clue_{i}`. Output your code in `<code></code>` blocks.
